Phase 1: Button Inventory & Route Planning (Continued)
Let's complete our inventory by checking the client layout for additional buttons:


Opened client/src/components/client/ClientLayout.tsx
Let's also check the API routes to identify all existing client-related endpoints:


Opened server/routes.ts
Let's check for client-related endpoints:


Executed grep -n "client" server/routes.ts | grep -i "app.get\|app.post\|app.put\|app.delete" | head -20
Great! I can now see all the client-related endpoints and the data being loaded on the client dashboard. Let's complete our button inventory based on this information.

Phase 1: Button Inventory & Route Planning Results
Based on my analysis, here's a complete inventory of the buttons on the client dashboard that need implementation:

Main Dashboard Buttons:
"View Projects" button - Navigate to projects list

Current: Links to static page
Required: Link to /client/projects route
"Contact Manager" button - Contact form/dialogue

Current: No implementation
Required: Open contact form modal or navigate to messaging page
"Start Conversation" button - Start messaging thread

Current: No implementation
Required: Initialize chat session with manager
"Configure" button (for email notifications)

Current: No implementation
Required: Open notification preferences modal
Project Card Buttons:
"Download Invoice #X" buttons - Invoice download
Current: Partial implementation with token-based authentication
Required: Secure PDF download functionality
Sidebar Navigation Buttons:
Security Center button - Security settings page

Current: Links to non-implemented page
Required: Implement security settings page
Help & Resources button - Help documentation

Current: Links to non-implemented page
Required: Implement help center page
Logout button - Log out user

Current: Implemented with logout function
Status: Working as expected
Header Navigation Buttons:
Profile Settings dropdown menu item - Edit profile

Current: Links to non-implemented page
Required: Implement profile settings page
Contact Support dropdown menu item - Support ticket

Current: Links to non-implemented page
Required: Implement support contact form
Sidebar Navigation Links (not buttons but clickable):
Dashboard (implemented)
My Projects (needs implementation)
Messages (needs implementation)
Documents (needs implementation)
Support (needs implementation)
Downloads (needs implementation)
Settings (needs implementation)
API Endpoints Inventory:
Currently Implemented Client Endpoints:
GET /api/public/client-projects/:clientId - List client projects
GET /api/public/client-invoices/:clientId - List client invoices
GET /api/public/client-documents/:clientId - List client documents
GET /api/public/client-contracts/:clientId - List client contracts
GET /api/client-communications/:clientId - Get client messages (authenticated)
POST /api/client-communications - Create client message (authenticated)
PUT /api/client-communications/:id/read - Mark message as read (authenticated)
GET /api/client-documents/:clientId - Get client documents (authenticated)
POST /api/client-documents - Upload client document (authenticated)
GET /api/client-documents/download/:id - Download client document (authenticated)
DELETE /api/client-documents/:id - Delete client document (authenticated)
Required New Endpoints:
POST /api/client/contact-manager - Send message to manager
GET /api/client/notification-preferences - Get notification settings
PUT /api/client/notification-preferences - Update notification settings
GET /api/client/security-settings - Get security settings
PUT /api/client/security-settings - Update security settings
Authentication & Authorization Assessment:
The application uses both JWT token authentication and localStorage fallback
Most client-specific data endpoints are publicly accessible with clientId parameter
Some endpoints require authentication with the authenticateJWT middleware
The client dashboard verifies the user has roleId 1001 (client role)
Development Plan for Button Implementation:
Phase 1: Core Navigation Implementation

Implement routing for all client sidebar links first:
/client/projects
/client/messages
/client/documents
/client/support
/client/downloads
/client/settings
Phase 2: Basic Form Actions

Implement "Contact Manager" and "Start Conversation" buttons with proper forms and API calls
Phase 3: Settings & Preferences

Implement configuration buttons for email notifications
Implement security center functionality
Phase 4: Document Management

Enhance document download functionality with proper security
Implement document upload functionality
